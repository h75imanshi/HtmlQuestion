<h3>
<pre>
    The elements that begin on a new line are known as block elements. A block element takes up the full width of the content. Unlike inline, there exists a top and bottom margin for these elements.
 Block-level elements may only appear inside the body tag. Block-level elements create a larger structure than inline elements. strong
Example of Block elements:
div, p, li, main, nav, ul, form, video, table, aside, article are some of the inline tags
</pre>

<h3> Inline-Block Elements:</h3>
    <h4>The display value of inline-block works similarly to inline with one exception: the height and width of that element become modifiable.
    </h4>
    <h2>Differences between Block and Inline-block</h2>
    <ol type="1">
        <h3> Block</h3>

        <li>Examples: div, p, li, main, etc</li>
        <li>CSS property: display:block</li>
    </ol>
    <ol type="1">
        <h3> Inline-Block</h3>
        <li>It remains inline with all the text around the element and appears the same as inline.</li>
        <li> It has no tag examples as it can be applied to any tag using CSS.</li>
        <li> CSS property: display:inline-block</li>
    </ol>
<h2> Question:6  Difference between em and Block Elements </h2>
<h3>
    Ans:  
    Em tag:</h3>
    The <em> tag is used to define emphasized text. The content inside is typically displayed in italic.

       <h3> 
        Block element:</h3>
        A block-level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers automatically add some space (a margin) before and after the element.

        Two commonly used block elements are: <p> and <div>.
            <ol type="A">
                <li>The <p> element defines a paragraph in an HTML document.</li>
                    <li>The <div> element defines a division or a section in an HTML document.</li>
                        <li>he <p> element is a block-level element.</li>
                     <li>The <div> element is a block-level element.</li>       
            </ol>
        
<h2>Question:7  What are attributes? </h2>
<h3>Ans:</h3>
<ol type="1">
    <li>
